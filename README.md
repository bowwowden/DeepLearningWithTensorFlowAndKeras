# DeepLearningWithTensorFlowAndKeras
Github for working through Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras &lt;packt> book by Amita Kapoor, Antonio Gulli, Sujit Pal.

In many of these notes I may be paraphrasing or writing out useful facts from the book. This repository is just for note taking. This is not original content. Just trying to read critically.
